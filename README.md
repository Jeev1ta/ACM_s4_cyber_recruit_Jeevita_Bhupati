Hey there!! I am Jeevita Bhupati, a second year student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

My interest in cybersecurity started as something I thought was cool after watching it in movies and reading about it in books. I didn’t really explore it seriously at first, but the tasks helped me look deeper into the field. Through it, I got to learn new concepts and understand more about how cybersecurity actually works, which made me more interested in it.
