For the wand challenge, as the question suggested that I needed to find out the name of the person who owned the wand, I used google lens search and got to know that it was the elder wand and it belonged to dumbledore. And the question also stated that the flag is in the image so I used the basic commands like exiftool, binwalk, and strings. Using strings revealed this “password: Full name of the weilder without spaces in small letters”. So I used an online steganography tool (I wasn’t able to do it from the terminal cause I couldn’t download it on my mac) and gave “albuspercivalwulfricbriandumbledore” as the password and got the flag!!!

Flag: potter{1_570l3_7h47_3ld3r_w4nd}
