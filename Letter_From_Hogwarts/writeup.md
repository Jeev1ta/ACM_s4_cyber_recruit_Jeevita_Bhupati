For the Letter from Hogwarts challenge, I first looked up in google to find out what commands are used on pdfs, especially the locked ones and found out about pdfcrack but it is a very slow process and then I got to know about John the Ripper, at first I created a wordlist with hogwarts themed words but I did not get any results and then I learned about rockyou wordlist from https://medium.com/@gurungatwork98/ctf-write-up-breaking-an-encrypted-pdf-to-retrieve-the-flag-364b5faf7e29

Using which I was able to crack the password "bud121clam725" and open the pdf which led me to the flag.

Flag : potter{w3lc0m3_70_h0gw4r75}
