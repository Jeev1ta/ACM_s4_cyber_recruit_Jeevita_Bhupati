For the challenge “This is for you know who”, after the file is unzipped I used the ls -a command and found out that there is a hidden directory called “.message to voldemort”, I entered into that folder and saw that there was an image named “top secret.png”. I used the strings command which started with RIFF and WEBPV8 which I’ve learnt meant that the file was not really a png file but rather a webp file so I first renamed it using the mv command and then used the binwalk command on it which revealed that the image had a zip file in it and I used the binwalk command with -e to extract it. A new folder with the name extractions was created, inside which there was another folder called “secret.webp.extracted” and I continued going into further folders the final path - “extractions/secret.webp.extracted/132A2/why always my nose” where the ls -a command again revealed hidden folder .secret, inside which there was an image horcux.jpg, I used the exiftool on it and the value of artist looked like a base64 encoded text so I used a decoder and it lead me to the flag
