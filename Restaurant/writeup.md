The restaurant task was hard to solve for me, at first I thought that the image had information hidden in it which led to me spending a lot of time trying all the commands like file, strings, exiftool, binwalk and also online steganography tools. I also used the google lens search and the location was revealed to be charminar, which made me think that it was the password for decoding the image in the steganography tool. On the last day of the challenge, I once again used the lens and searched up for restaurants which opened during the 1980’s. A lot of them showed up like Hotel Shadab, Pista House, Paradise etc, I looked up each restaurant separately and found out only Hotel Shadab was opened in the 1980’s and then I looked up the prices of chicken biryani in shadab which led me to multiple websites stating different prices and I tried each of them as the flag. At the end I found this menu “https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g297586-d1012414-i249950253-Shadab_Hotel_Restaurant-Hyderabad_Hyderabad_District_Telangana.html” where the price was 260, and when I tried it out, it turned out to be correct.

Flag: ACM{260}
